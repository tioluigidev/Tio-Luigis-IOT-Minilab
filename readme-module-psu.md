# PSU Module



## Description

The PSU (Power Supply Unity) Module is responsible to power up all the system. The main power switch is a 6A circuit breaker. In my project, I used a circuit breaker with residual current protection, to prevent electrical shock. There is also a power meter with a double display, for voltage and current measuring. The main power line ends in a power strip, in my case with 4 electrical outlets.

Connected to this power strip, there is an ATX Power Supply. For this project I used a 250W retail model. This ATX PSU powers the 4 terminal bars at the rear part of the rack. These terminal bars are used to power all the small circuits and IOT devices that uses 3.3V, 5V and/or 12V power.

The ATX PSU also powers a Workbench Module, used to provide voltage to workbench projects and experiments. Connected to this module, there is the ATX Power Switch, that starts up the ATX PSU and a potentiometer for adustable voltage output, provided by the workbench module too.
