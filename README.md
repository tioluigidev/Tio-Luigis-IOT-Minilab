## Description

This is my IoT minilab. A platform to develop projects and experiments involving the internet of things / web of things and digital electronics.
This is an open source project and you will find all the necessary information to reproduce this project, modify it, contribute, etc.

I hope you enjoy it :)



## Features

- Rack mounted in a "maker style" so you can easily modify, extend, create new modules, etc.
- You also can use it as a workbench tool.
- ATX PSU (3.3V, 5V, 12V and adjustable voltage) for the modules and for the workbench.
- USB PSU/charger, for those devices in the rack or on the workbench, that uses USB power cord .
- Small CPU module with USB hub for conecting to your IOT devices (yes, in the rack or on the workbench).
- Use ready-made parts, so you don´t have to make printed circuit boards!
